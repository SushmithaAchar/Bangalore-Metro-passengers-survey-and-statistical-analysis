###regression model where regular travelling is predicted with the rate of satisfaction
model1<-lm(satisfied~reg.trans+how.oft-1, data = mydata);model1
summary(model1)

###chi square test to test the association between reason and travelling often in metro
###i.e. is travelling often in metro is dependant on the reason why people choose metro
###ho=there is an association between reason and travelling often i.e. trav = reason
###h1=there is no association i.e. trav =! reason
chisq.test(table(trav.oft, reason))

###to test the strenth of association between how often people travel in metro 
###and how satisfied they are with metro
###but it is negatively correlated which means that how often is independent of satisfaction
cor.test(satisfied, how.oft)

###t test
###h0=mean of regular travel of students is equal to mean of regular travel of employees
###the results says reject the h0 as p value is less than 0.05 and 
###conclude that the means of two samples are not equal
random<-sample_n(mydata, 29)
student<-random$reg.trans[random$Occupation=="student"]
employed<-random$reg.trans[random$Occupation=="Employed"]
t.test(student,employed,alternative = "two.sided",var.equal = FALSE,conf.level=0.95)
